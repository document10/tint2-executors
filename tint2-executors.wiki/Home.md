While playing with Openbox, we often need a script to perform some actions not included OOTB. Having to search the same answers again and again on each new machine, I thought it was worth documenting them somewhere for further use.

The [Tint2 panel](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2) - a brilliant and flexible piece of software - allows to execute scripts every certain period of time. And here you are my collection of scripts and executors (not that I use them all together). Some of them have been separated as the [psuinfo project](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/psuinfo).

### Installation:

Clone the repository to your home directory:

`$ git clone https://github.com/nwg-piotr/tint2-executors.git`

To install all dependencies in one step, you can download the [tint2-executors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/tint2-executors/raw/master/tint2-executors-0.0.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz) dummy package. **Attention: just added, not yet really tested, so some dependencies may still be missing.**

Select a page from menu for more info and sample Tint2 executors.
